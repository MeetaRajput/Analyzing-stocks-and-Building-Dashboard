# Analyzing-stock-performance-and-Building-a-Dashboard
This Python project which helps customers to invest their money in stocks. I extracted financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data, I visualized it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends using Line-graphs. The stocks I worked with are Tesla and GameStop.
